Give it a try and divide the whole page into three to four different sections. Set 3-4 background images, align the text for different sections, set margin and padding, add background-position and other CSS elements and properties to create a parallax effect.

                <p>A landing page is another good project you can make using HTML and CSS but it requires a solid knowledge of these two building blocks. You will be using lots of creativity while making a landing page. You will practice how to add footer and header, create columns, align-items, divide the sections and a lot of things. You will have to use CSS carefully keeping in mind that different elements do not overlap with each other. You will also take care of color combinations, padding, margin, space between sections, paragraphs, and boxes. Color combinations should go well with each other for different sections or backgrounds.</p>
